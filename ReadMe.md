# Cut Classification 

## Overview
The user uploads a .jpg image of a haircut which is fed to the model returning an output to determine the type of haircut. 

## Neural Network
- Built using TensorFlow Keras
    - Works like API
- Datasets: Train, Test, Validation
    - Validation: Mimics real-world inputs and increases accuracy -> model validates results against this dataset
- Sequential Neural Network Model
    - Linear stack of layers where each layer has one input tensor and one output tensor
